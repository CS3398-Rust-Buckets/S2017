Full Calendar

A full-sized drag & drop event calendar (jQuery plugin).

I found a calendar written in javaScript using the jQuery library. 

Disclaimer:   FullCalendar is great for displaying events, but it 
isn't a complete solution for event content-management. Beyond dragging 
an event to a different time/day, you cannot change an event's name or 
other associated data. It is up to you to add this functionality through 
FullCalendar's event hooks. 

It looks like how I imagined our interactive calendar would look like,
but lacks the content-management. So, we will have to see how to implement
FullCalendar "event hooks". The repository can be found below:

I have no experience with javaScript, so I will be using Lyndia.com with my Texas State credentials 
to learn javaScript.

Goal: Display the full-sized drag & drop event calendar on website.
